\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}


This PhD would never have been completed without the support, encouragement, and guidance that my supervisor, Paul Rayson, has given and still does, in which I will always be thankful for. I would like to thank Gerald Kotonya for the pre-PhD chat, which motivated me throughout the PhD. Similarly I am thankful for the support, advice, and time that Steven Young has given throughout the PhD. Thank you also to all of the past and current members of the C28 office and the NLP group. Lancaster University has been a great place to study for the last eight years, which in most has been due to the friends and work colleagues I have got to know, and the spectacular scenery that is Lancashire. This PhD would not have been possible without the funding from Lancaster University by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Grant.

Outside of the PhD I am thankful to Jake Brown for being such a great friend throughout the PhD.

Finally none of this would have been possible without the continual support and encouragement of my family June, Jonathan, and Christopher Moore this achievement is as much mine as it is theirs. A special thank you to Bella, my families German Shorthaired Pointer, who can never fail to bring a smile to your face at least once a day.
